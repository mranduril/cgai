    Assignment 2A: Volumetric Rendering
</h1>

<p class="mb-4">
    Welcome to the first part of our exploration of NeRF! In this assignment, you explore the first and crucial backbone under the NeRF framework -- volumetric ray tracing! 
    The main task for this assignment is to first create two volumetric data, a volumetric sphere colored by its SDF and a CT scan loaded using 3D texture. 
    Then, you will render the data using the volumetric rendering method we taught in class. All implementions will be in our WebGL shader. Let's get started!

<h2 class="h2-custom">Requirements</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
    For this assignment, you are expected to implement three components to render volumetric data with an ray marching framework: <em>calculate color and density from sdf</em>, <em>calculate color and density from CT data,</em> and <em>ray tracing with volumetric data</em>. We will briefly discuss each step as follows.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 1: calculate color and density from sdf</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    You are tasked to convert the SDF value into a <code>vec4</code>, where the first three components store RGB color and the fourth represents density. 
    We provided you the SDF value in the <code>distance</code> variable. You should use the given <code>palette</code> function to map the value to an RGB color. 
    Notice, we use the <code>-distance</code> value for calculating <code>palette</code> to ensure uniform color tone with Step 2.
    Finally, you will set the density to 1.0 for points inside the object (SDF < 0) and 0.0 for points outside (SDF â‰¥ 0).
</p>
<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 2: calculate color and density from CT data</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    You are asked to convert the CT data into a <code>vec4</code>, where the first three components represent RGB color and the fourth component represents density. 
    You first need to retrieve the density value from the first channel of the volumetric texture <code>iVolume</code>. 
    You can use the built-in <code>texture</code> function in GLSL to query <code>iVolume</code> based on the texture coordinate <code>tex_coord</code>.
    Then, you will use the provided <code>palette</code> function to map the density value to an RGB color. Optionally, you can multiply the resulting <code>vec4</code> by a constant (e.g. 2.0) to enhance visualization.
</p>

<h3 class="h3-custom">Step 3: ray tracing with volumetric data</h3>
<p class="mb-4">
    You are asked to implement the front-to-back volumetric ray tracing algorithm to accummulate colors along each ray. You will accumulate color and transmittance along the ray based on the absorption-emission volumetric model. We briefly describe the mathematical model as below:
    <!-- Recall from course slides, transmittance depicts its probability of passing through a volumetric data.  -->
    <!-- Considering only absorption in the volumetric rendering equation, for uniform density (i.e. uniform extinction coefficient), the transmittance (probability) of a ligh can be descibed using: -->

    Recall the volumetric rendering equation for only considering absorption can be written as:</br>
    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq1.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
    the discritized version is:</br>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq2.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
    Assuming a small truncation of volumetric data with uniform density, the inner integral can be written as:</br>
    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq4.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
    Hence, the final version becomes:</br>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq5.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
    with the accumulated transmittance defined as:</br>
    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq6.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>

    Here, within the summation, the first term gives the probability that the light pass through the previous media and reaches the current point, hence gives the attenuation that need to be applied to the color.
    The second term denotes the probability the light terminates here and hence the camera sees the color of the media.  <br/>

    We provide you the for-loop for calculating this summation. In each iteration, you should <br/>
    <strong>(1)</strong> Read in the color and density value from both the sphere SDF (using <code>readSDFVolume</code>) and the CT texture (using <code>readCTVolume</code>). 
    You will place the CT volume by subtracting the query point with an offset of its center and place the sphere SDF volume centering using the same method. The center of the CT volume is located at [2, 0, 0] and the center of the SDF volume is located at [-2, 0, 0].<br/>
    <strong>(2)</strong> Following the equations given above, you will first use the accumualted transmittance and the extinction coefficient to accumulate color at the current point:</br>
    <div class="image-container2">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq7.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
    <strong>(3)</strong> You will accumulate the transmittance in preparetion for the next iteration.</br>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/assignments/A2a_img/r_eq8.png" alt="cases" width="auto" height="auto">
    </div>
    </br>
</p>

<p>Once you finish implementation of the steps above, you should see a video shown below:</p>

<h2 class="h2-custom">Creative Expression</h2>
In the Creative Expression section of this assignment, you are encouraged to create your own volumetric rendering scene by leveraging the volumetric ray tracing framework you've implemented. You may choose to render new volumetric data (we've provided a few in the starter code, you may also download new ones from this
<a href="https://klacansky.com/open-scivis-datasets/" class="link-inline">link</a>), or you may choose to render new SDF functions as a volumetric media. You are encouraged to play with the default <code>palette</code> function to achieve different volumetric appearance. 

We expect your Creative Expression volumetric rendering scene to demonstrate the visual appealing aspect of participating media. The creative expression theme for this assignment is <strong>Nebulous Realms</strong>.
